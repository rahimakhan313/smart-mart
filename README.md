# smart-mart

#This project particularly aims at the automation of various management procedures in a supermarket like managing sales and purchases, stock details, details about the products or goods available in the supermarket, customer details which will include the purchased items, name and address of the customer, proper billing and delivery details for each customer, as well as the overall proﬁt gained from each product which can only be viewed by the administrator, and other facilities. All the details and records in the supermarket will be maintained in a database. Therefore, this system will provide an eﬃcient way of managing the supermarket information and allow the customers to purchase and pay for their items in any way they want (cash on delivery or credit card)
